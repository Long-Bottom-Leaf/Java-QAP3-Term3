# Java OOP Projects

This repository contains multiple Java Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) exercises and assignments.  
Each project demonstrates key OOP principles such as inheritance, abstraction, polymorphism, and interfaces.

---

## 🧩 Project Overview

Each folder (e.g., `Problem1`, `Problem2`, `Problem3`, etc.) contains a self-contained Java program.  
Each program includes:

- Complete `.java` source files  
- A main driver or demo class (e.g., `Demo.java`) to run and test the program  
- Example outputs and screenshots (if applicable)

---

## 💡 Concepts Demonstrated

- Abstract classes and inheritance hierarchies  
- Method overriding and polymorphism  
- Interface implementation and multiple inheritance via interfaces  
- Encapsulation and data validation  
- Static methods and shared behavior  
- Arrays of objects and iterative processing  

---

## 🛠️ Requirements

To compile and run the programs, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Java JDK 17** or newer  
- A Java-compatible IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, VS Code)  
  or access to the **command line** tools (`javac` and `java`)

No external libraries or frameworks are required — all code uses standard Java SE.

## 🚀 How to Compile and Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/java-oop-projects.git
   cd java-oop-projects
   
2. Navigate to the problem folder you want to run:
   cd Problem3
   
3. Compile all source files:
   javac *.java

4. Run the demo or main class:
   java Demo
